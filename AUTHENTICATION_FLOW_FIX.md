# Authentication Flow Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Redirect After Login** âœ…
- **Problem**: Users were not redirected to dashboard after successful login
- **Solution**: 
  - Added sessionStorage persistence for auth state
  - Added setTimeout delay to ensure state updates before navigation
  - Login form now checks if already authenticated and redirects

### 2. **Session Persistence** âœ…
- **Problem**: Auth state was lost on page navigation/refresh
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented sessionStorage to persist user data during browser session
  - AuthContext now checks and restores user from sessionStorage on mount
  - Logout properly clears sessionStorage

### 3. **Protected Route Flow** âœ…
- **Problem**: Protected routes were not properly checking authentication
- **Solution**:
  - All protected routes now properly redirect to login if not authenticated
  - Login page redirects to dashboard if already authenticated
  - Preserves intended destination when redirecting to login

### 4. **Business Flow Correction** âœ…
- **Correct Flow**:
  1. **Login** â†’ Dashboard
  2. **Dashboard** â†’ Job Role Selection (via "Start Interview Simulation" button)
  3. **Job Role Selection** â†’ Document Upload
  4. **Document Upload** â†’ CV Review
  5. **CV Review** â†’ Interview Simulation
  
- **Fixed**:
  - Hero CTA now goes to `/job-role-selection` instead of `/upload`
  - Job role selection passes selected role to document upload
  - Document upload passes job role to CV review
  - Maintains context throughout the flow

## Implementation Details

### AuthContext Updates
- Added sessionStorage save on login
- Added sessionStorage restore on mount
- Added sessionStorage clear on logout
- Login function returns boolean for success/failure

### Navigation Updates
- Added 100ms delay after login to ensure state updates
- Login form checks authentication state and auto-redirects
- Protected routes properly redirect unauthenticated users

### Business Flow Updates
- Job role is passed through navigation state
- Each page in the flow passes necessary context to the next

## Testing Steps

1. **Login Flow**:
   - Go to http://localhost:5174/login
   - Login with email/password or Google SSO
   - âœ… Should redirect to dashboard

2. **Session Persistence**:
   - After login, refresh the page
   - âœ… Should remain logged in

3. **Protected Routes**:
   - Logout and try to access /dashboard
   - âœ… Should redirect to login

4. **Business Flow**:
   - From dashboard, click "Start Interview Simulation"
   - âœ… Goes to Job Role Selection
   - Select a role and click Next
   - âœ… Goes to Document Upload
   - Upload a document and click Next
   - âœ… Goes to CV Review
   - Continue through the flow
