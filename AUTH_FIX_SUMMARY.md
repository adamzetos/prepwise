# Authentication Error Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Chrome Extension Errors** (Not Application Related)
   - The errors from `chrome-extension://kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen` are from the Grammarly browser extension
   - These can be safely ignored as they don't affect the application

2. **Token Format Mismatch**
   - `AuthContext.tsx` was expecting JWT tokens only (Google Sign-In format)
   - `GoogleSignInCustomButton.tsx` was providing user info directly (OAuth2 format)
   - Email/password login was creating base64-encoded JSON (not a valid JWT)

3. **atob Decoding Error**
   - The error occurred at line 51 in `AuthContext.tsx`
   - Caused by trying to decode non-JWT tokens as JWT

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated AuthContext.tsx
- Modified the `login` function to handle multiple token formats:
  - JWT tokens from Google Sign-In (credential with dot-separated parts)
  - Base64-encoded JSON (fallback for mock credentials)
  - Direct user objects (from OAuth2 flow)
- Added proper error handling for each format

### 2. Updated GoogleSignInCustomButton.tsx
- Changed from creating fake credentials to passing user info directly
- Removed unnecessary btoa encoding
- Simplified the authentication flow

### 3. Updated LoginForm.tsx
- Fixed mock email/password login to pass user object directly
- Removed btoa encoding from mock credentials
- Ensured consistent authentication flow

### 4. Updated GoogleSignInButton.tsx
- Added proper success checking before navigation
- Added setTimeout to ensure state updates complete

## Testing the Fix

1. **Email/Password Login**: Should now work without decoding errors
2. **Google OAuth Login**: Should work with the custom button
3. **Google Sign-In**: Should work with the standard button (if used)

## How the Fix Works

The updated `login` function in `AuthContext.tsx` now intelligently handles different response formats:

```javascript
if (googleResponse.credential) {
  // Try JWT decoding first
  // Fall back to JSON parsing if not a JWT
} else if (googleResponse.email) {
  // Handle direct user object
}
```

This ensures compatibility with:
- Google's standard Sign-In (JWT credentials)
- OAuth2 flow (direct user info)
- Mock authentication (for development)

## Verification

Open the application at http://localhost:5174/ and test:
1. Email/password login
2. Google sign-in button
3. Check browser console for any authentication errors

The authentication should now work without any atob decoding errors.
