Halfway through, we realized our content calendar didn't align with the target audience's peak engagement times. I suggested we re-analyze the data in Google Analytics and adjust posting schedules. I collaborated with the team to revise the calendar and reallocate tasks quickly. Despite the adjustment period, by shifting during the campaign, and the client was really pleased with our responsiveness.",
